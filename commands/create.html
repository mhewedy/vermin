    <p>
      <code>create</code> subcommand used to create a new VM from
      <a href="https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search" target="_blank">Vagrant Boxes</a>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      This is usually your start command to use in vermin.
    </p>

    <p>
      To create a new VM, you need to pass a required parameter of the image name,
      <code>vermin create &lt;image name &gt;</code> e.g.:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ vermin create ubuntu/focal64
<graycode>✔ Creating vm_01 from image ubuntu/focal64
✔ Setting bridged network adapter
✔ Starting vm_01
✔ Establishing connection

VM is ready, to connect to it use:
$ vermin ssh vm_01</graycode>
    </pre>

    <div class="alert alert-light">
      Vermin uses vagrant boxes to create a new VMs, so you need to provide a valid vagrant box name in the form of
      <code>user/box</code>. for example: ubuntu/focal64.
      <a href="https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search" target="_blank">Here</a> you can find a list of all vagrant boxes
    </div>


    <p>
      Once you have a VM created from the chosen image, it is
      <link-start>started</link-start>
      as well and you can now start use it by
      <link-ssh></link-ssh>
      into it.
    </p>

    <hr/>
    <h4>Customizing Resources</h4>
    <p>
      By default, every VM created assigned <b>1 vcpu</b> and <b>1024 megabyte</b> memory. This can be changed at the
      time of the creation of the VM or later using the
      <link-update></link-update>
      command.
    </p>
    <p>
      To override the defaults at the creation time, you need to pass one of two parameters or both;
      <code>-c|--cpus</code> for cpu
      and <code>-m|--mem</code> for memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following code snipped will create a VM from centos/8 image with 2 cpus and 512 megabyte memory:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ vermin create centos/8 -c 2 -m 512
<graycode>✔ Creating vm_03 from image centos/8
✔ Setting bridged network adapter
✔ Starting vm_03
✔ Establishing connection

VM is ready, to connect to it use:
$ vermin ssh vm_03</graycode>
    </pre>

    <hr/>
    <h4>Provisioners</h4>
    <p>Vermin adapts the concept of provisioners where you can provision the VM as part of the creation process.</p>
    <p>
      Vermin supports two type of prisioners:
    <ul>
      <li>Shell</li>
      <li>Ansible</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Shell provisioner</h5>
    <p>
      vermin support shell provisioning by providing a shell script that is run using a regular user <code>vermin</code>.
      However you can use the <code>sudo</code> command.

    </p>
    <div>
      <p>Sample provision script:</p>
      <pre>
# install redis
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install redis-server -y
sudo sed -i 's/^supervised no/supervised systemd/' /etc/redis/redis.conf
sudo systemctl restart redis.service
sudo systemctl status redis
      </pre>

      <p>You need to save the provision script into a file and pass the file path to the create subcommand:</p>
      <pre>
$ vermin create ubuntu/focal64 -m 2048 redis.sh
<graycode>✔ Creating vm_01 from image ubuntu/focal64
✔ Setting bridged network adapter
✔ Starting vm_01
✔ Establishing connection
Provisioning vm_01

VM is ready, to connect to it use:
  $ vermin ssh vm_01</graycode>
    </pre>

      <p>We created a VM of image ubuntu/focal64 with 1 cpu (the default) and 2048 megabytes memory and installed redis
        on
        it</p>

    </div>


    <h5>Ansible provisioner</h5>
    <p>
      Ansible is a well-known configuration management tool. vermin support ansible playbooks to provision VMs as part
      of the creation process.

    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-light">
      Note: You need to set the <code>hosts</code> property to <code>all</code> in the playbook.
    </div>

    <p>Here's a sample playbook:</p>
    <pre>
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - package:
      name: apache2
      state: present
    </pre>
    <p>And here's an example:</p>
    <pre>
$ vermin create ubuntu/focal64 -t ansible apache2.yaml
<graycode>✔ Creating vm_01 from image ubuntu/focal64
✔ Setting bridged network adapter
✔ Starting vm_01
✔ Establishing connection
Provisioning vm_01

    <div class="alert alert-light">
      Note: we need to pass the flag the <code>-t|--type</code> flag. In case of ansible use <code>-t ansible</code>.
      in case of shell, you can pass <code>-t shell</code> which is the default behaviour.
    </div>

    <h4>Network</h4>
    <p>
      vermin uses the bridge network of VirtualBox by default, and it will not function properly if you choose to change
      this settings.

      In fact being uses the bridge network it will allow the VMs to access other devices on the network of the host
      directly including other VMs.
