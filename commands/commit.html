    <p><code>commit</code> is one of the most advanced subcommand that enabled you to take vermin to the next level.

      It allows you to build you own images and store them locally so to use them later to create your
      own VMs.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will need to start with one of the provided images by vermin and configure the VM as needed then commit this
      VM into an image.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's take scenario where you already created a VM using one of the provided image by vermin (e.g. ubuntu/focal64)
      the normal way using <code>vermin create ubuntu/focal64</code>, and installed <b>ELK stack</b> or did any other
      configuration you
      need.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now you can commit your VM into an image as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ vermin commit vm_01 elk/elastic
<graycode>✔ Committing vm_01 into image elk/elastic

Image is ready, to create a VM from it use:
$ vermin create elk/elastic</graycode>
    </pre>

    <p>
      Once this command completes, you now have a new image stored locally at <code>~/.vermin/images</code>.
      You can list the images using the
      <link-images></link-images>
      command, as follows:
    </p>

    <pre>
$ vermin images
<graycode>IMAGE NAME                              DISK
ubuntu/focal64                          0.5GB
elk/elastic                             1.2GB
</graycode>
    </pre>

    <div class="alert alert-light">
      You need to make sure you stop the VM before creating an image from it, otherwise you will got a message
      indicating that.
    </div>

    <p>You can start creating VMs from that image as follows:</p>
    <pre>
$ vermin create elk/elastic
<graycode>⢿ Creating vm_04 from image elk/elastic
...
...</graycode>
    </pre>

    <p>listing the VMs shows the complete information about the VM:</p>
    <pre>
$ vermin ps -f image=elk
<graycode>VM NAME        IMAGE                      CPUS      MEM       DISK         TAGS
vm_04          elk/elastic                1         1024      2.8GB</graycode>
    </pre>

    <div class="alert alert-light">
      You need to be careful and not to remove the committed image as long as you need it. check the
      <link-images></link-images>
      command to know more about images cache.
    </div>

    <h5>Override images</h5>
    <p>
      By default, you cannot commit an image with the same name already exists, however you can override such setting
      using <code>--override</code> flag.
    </p>

    <div class="alert alert-light">
      You can work with a VM created from an image, and remove the image itself. there's no strong relation between the
      images and the VMs created from.
